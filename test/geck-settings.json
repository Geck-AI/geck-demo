      "technicalNotes": "**Element Selection Guidelines**\n\n1. **Selecting Products or Items**\n   When an instruction says to “click on [product/item],” always choose the main product link that opens the product detail page. This is usually the clickable image, title, or the primary link for the product card.\n   Do *not* click action buttons inside the card such as **Add to Cart**, **Buy Now**, **Quick View**, or **Wishlist**.\n\n2. **Navigation Links**\n   Prefer using the main navigation menu at the top of the page whenever possible. Only use footer or sidebar links if the instruction explicitly points to them.\n\n3. **Choosing the Correct Button**\n   If multiple similar buttons exist (for example, “Login,” “Login with Google,” or “Login with OTP”), select the primary or standard button unless the instruction clearly specifies otherwise.\n   The primary button is typically more prominent and placed in the main action area.\n\n4. **Form Fields**\n   When interacting with forms, rely on visible labels or placeholders to identify fields.\n\n   * Email fields usually have labels or placeholders containing “Email,” or use `type=\"email\"`.\n   * Password fields contain “Password” or use `type=\"password\"`.\n\n5. **Action vs. Navigation**\n   Action buttons trigger an operation (submit, add, delete, save) without navigating to a new page. Navigation links take the user to another URL.\n   If the instruction says “click on [item],” it generally refers to a navigation link, not an action button.\n\n6. **Hierarchy of Elements**\n   When the instruction refers to an entire product or item, choose the main clickable container or parent element—not a smaller nested element.\n   For example, clicking a “product card” means selecting the main product link, not any buttons inside the card.\n\n7. Click the shopping cart icon in the navbar.\nIMPORTANT:\n- Click the <a> tag whose href contains '/cart'\n- Do NOT click the wishlist or favourites icon\n- Do NOT click the <a> with href '/favourites'\n\n\n",
